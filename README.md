An exercise in node.js and MySQL

Customer Instructions
* The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
* The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
   * If not, the app should log a phrase like `Insufficient quantity!`, and then prevent the order from going through.

* If your store _does_ have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.
* This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.


* After the ID selection and quantity is determined by the customer, the customer will be prompted if they want to continue shopping.
    * If Yes, they will be brought back to selecting another Item_ID
    * If NO, they will be done (at this point, this is the end of the application).
